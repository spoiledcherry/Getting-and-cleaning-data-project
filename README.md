# Getting and cleaning data project

#Introduction

This Github repo contains my scripts for project course of Getting and cleaning data.
In this project, data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was retrieved, worked with, and cleaned, to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
This repo contains below files: 
README.md, which is the overview of all the files.
CODEBOOK.md, that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed.
run_analysis.R, that describe how I run the analysis.
tidy.txt, contains the tidy data set created as required.

#Requirements for data analysis

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
